# Phoenix-WebApp-Learning
 A small ecommerce webapp project to learn more about Elixir, Phoenix, and common webapp paradigms like MVC and REST.
 
 This is a toy project based on the official Phoenix guides (https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/1.7.0-rc.0/) in order to get more familiar with Elixir, Phoenix, and web application technologies and conventions.
